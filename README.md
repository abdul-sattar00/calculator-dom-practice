## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me understand several important concepts:

- ✔ Real-world use of `addEventListener()`  
- ✔ DOM Manipulation (buttons → screen output)  
- ✔ Writing JavaScript logic step-by-step  
- ✔ Debugging errors and fixing issues 😅  

---

## ⚠️ Honest Note

I didn’t focus much on design in this project.  
My **main goal** was to strengthen **JavaScript logic**, because:

> **Strong logic = Strong developer 💪**

Design can always be polished later 😉

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🎨 Improve UI/UX design  
- ⌨️ Add keyboard support  
- 🧹 Optimize and refactor JavaScript code
